This czar would regulate leagues to reduce games, prevent public stadium funding, and improve scheduling. By emphasizing quality over profits, the czar would ensure sports maintain their societal value while addressing issues caused by antitrust exemptions."

Noted sports columnist Bill Simmons, formerly of ESPN and now the Ringer, has advocated for the creation of an American Sports Czar. He's never given much detail about the idea, so I'm going to do that for him.

Sports, much like other forms of entertainment, has characteristics of a public good. A public good, in economic terms, is something that one person can consume without reducing its availability to others. In fact, in the case of sports, the opposite is often true: the enjoyment of one fan can amplify the enjoyment of others. Economists such as Paul Samuelson first described public goods as goods that are **non-excludable** (available to everyone) and **non-rivalrous** (one person’s consumption doesn’t reduce another’s). The communal experience of sports exemplifies this. A packed stadium, roaring with excitement, doesn’t diminish my fan experience—it enhances it.

If sports were a pure public good, however, it would be underprovided. This is because public goods suffer from the **free-rider problem**, where individuals can benefit without paying, leaving no incentive for private entities to supply the good. Instead, we have leagues like the NFL, which function as monopolistic providers of professional sports entertainment. These leagues enjoy **antitrust exemptions**, a legal status granted by Congress, allowing them to coordinate schedules, negotiate collective broadcasting contracts, and limit competition.

The justification for these antitrust protections is rooted in history. The sports leagues argued that they needed such exemptions to ensure fair competition on the field and financial stability off it. Without antitrust protections, the leagues claimed, the competition between teams would extend to business operations, leading to financial ruin and a fragmented fan experience. However, this structure has led to an unintended, perverse outcome: professional sports are now over-provided, with a relentless focus on maximizing revenue at the expense of quality.

Consider the NFL. The league has increased the number of regular-season games from 16 to 17, expanded the number of playoff teams, and even scheduled games on Christmas Day. The Kansas City Chiefs and three other teams were forced to play three games in just 11 days—hardly a schedule conducive to player safety or peak performance. These decisions are driven by lucrative TV contracts, not by a genuine effort to “grow the game.” If the leagues were truly interested in expanding the reach of their sport, they would increase the number of teams, not games. However, this approach conflicts with the interests of team owners, who prioritize profit margins over long-term fan satisfaction.

The consequences of these decisions are evident: tired players, watered-down quality, and an oversaturated schedule. Fans face late-night games that their children can’t watch, while players suffer the wear and tear of a grueling season. To optimize the quality of professional sports, we need to reduce the number of games—14 NFL games, 50 NBA and NHL games, and 154 MLB games would strike a much better balance.

### The Role of a Sports Czar

Because professional sports leagues depend on congressional exemptions from antitrust laws, we have leverage to demand reform. This is where a **sports czar** could step in. The czar’s primary responsibility would be to maximize the quality of the games, with three key priorities:

1. **Player Safety:** Ensuring athletes are protected from undue physical harm.
2. **Fan Convenience:** Prioritizing in-stadium fan experiences and accessibility.
3. **Community Benefits:** Supporting the local economies and communities that host these teams.

Under a sports czar, leagues would only be able to expand by increasing the number of teams, not by overloading the schedule. Any new domed indoor stadiums, which pose risks to athletes, due to that horrific artificial turf, would be banned. Public funding for stadiums would no longer be extorted from cities. More afternoon games would return, reviving the magic of a daytime World Series.

### A Better Fan Experience

The sports czar could also mandate significant changes for fans. Imagine no more commercial breaks interrupting the flow of the game. Broadcasters could display ads via crawlers, split screens, or even overlay ads during gameplay, much like European soccer. Watching a match uninterrupted would elevate the experience for both TV viewers and stadium fans alike.

### Why Sports Deserves Regulation

Unlike other forms of entertainment, sports is inherently a **zero-sum game**. It creates winners and losers in a way that movies, music, or other arts never can. This unique quality teaches virtues like courage, creativity, and teamwork. Sportsmanship reinforces public values and strengthens communities. Because of its profound societal impact, there is a compelling public interest in regulating professional sports leagues. A sports czar would ensure that the leagues prioritize the long-term health of the game and its players, rather than short-term profits.

By establishing a sports czar, we can preserve what makes sports special and ensure that the fan experience, player safety, and community interests are never compromised.
